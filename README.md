# Setup Concept Links Page

I once had an instagram page that was focused on sharing content related to setups.
I wanted to expand so that it becomes a brand and I even needed a page of links to redirect to external content,
but as a programmer obviously I couldn't use the common solution (linktree), 
so I ended up coding the entire site.
The page did not continue, but I liked the result so I leave the code here as a good memory.
